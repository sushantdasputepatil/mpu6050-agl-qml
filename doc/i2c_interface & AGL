I2C interface & AGL:
In mpu-temp application we use /dev/i2c-1 interface of rpi
while using this interface we got error like cannot start[] after starting installed application,after some debugging we see that our /dev/i2c-dev node is not generating so we see if there is i2c-dev after lsmod,it is absent there,in kernel there is a module for i2c-dev but it it not auto loading so after modprobe i2c-dev our application started normally.
So we have to automate this process of loading of the kernal module of i2c-dev so in /etc/modules/ we added module i2c-dev.If this problem still continues you have to Dynamically Loading Device Tree Overlays into Linux Kernel.
Linux allows the Kernel to be configured at run time, to enable or disable different services as you see fit. This way you don't have to compile a monolithic kernel, and can save some memory usage. Some modules you'll only need for a short time, others you'll need all the time. You can configure your Linux machine to load kernel modules on startup so you don't have to remember to do that when (if) you reboot.
modprobe is a Linux program originally written by Rusty Russell and used to add a loadable kernel module (LKM) to the Linux kernel or to remove a LKM from the kernel. It is commonly used indirectly: udev relies upon modprobe to load drivers for automatically detected hardware.
modprobe intelligently adds or removes a module from the Linux kernel: note that for convenience, there is no difference between _ and - in module names. modprobe looks in the module directory /lib/modules/‘uname -r‘ for all the modules and other files, except for the optional /etc/modprobe.conf configuration file and /etc/modprobe.d directory. modprobe will also use module options specified on the kernel command line in the form of <module>.<option>
Also keep sure that you have uncomment the dtparameter for i2c in config.txt in boot partition
